        \item {Three nodes are a k3s cluster running on Raspberry Pis with MetalLB in layer2 mode to serve as a load balancer}
        \item {The OS for each k3s node is Ubuntu 20.04 converged with Ansible and the persistent volumes are satisfied by a consumer NAS}
        \item {A fourth and primary physical node is a consumer grade hardware box with prosumer hybrid drives in a ZFS mirrored pool. The node is named megamind}
        \item {Megamind's underlying operating system is NixOS and immutable deployments to the OS are done via deploy-rs and Nix flakes; failed state applies trigger automatic rollback to last OS state snapshot}
        \item {Megamind runs applications and services via Nomad, Consul, Vault}
        \item {Individual applications are able to publish their metrics endpoints to Consul and then have their metrics collected via Prometheseus and displayed using Grafana}
        \item {Cloudflare handles DNS with subdomains routing to specific services via Traefik; Let's Encrypt is used to provide SSL certs via the DNS challenge method}
        \item {Homelab serves as a personal PaaS that Elixir and Go services are deployed to}
